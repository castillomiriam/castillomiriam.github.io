A graphic designer from El Paso, Texas—a border city between the U.S. and Mexico—the culture of the border is intrinsic to my identity: Native proficiency of English and Spanish and both my mom and sister are Mexico born. I come from a working-class background, which engendered the dedication necessary for me to be the first of my family to finish college. I am a full-time graphic designer at an established local printing company. However, I am amidst a shift in career, as my present career path prospects have left me wanting more. The more I learn and gain familiarity through preliminary work, the more interested I became in Software Development. The decision to break away from Graphic Design led me to research a variety of coding bootcamps, until I finally found my place in Flatiron.

From early adolescence, I have always had an interest in coding; I used to tinker around with HTML and CSS via MySpace, GeoCities, and the like. I had never delved further than the fundamentals, yet I maintained my curiosity and desire to learn by reading the source code and trying to figure out how things behaved by trial and error.

After extensive and exhaustive research on various bootcamps, Flatiron became the strongest option. I subscribed to receive e-mails for more information regarding the programs and had started to look at the free curriculum, when I saw an e-mail regarding the Accelerated Bootcamp Prep course. The timing of which was nothing short of ideal, and, now enrolled in the program, I am on my way to completing the curricula. Despite having lofty expectation for my ability to comprehend the concepts with ease and facility, I am proud to say that I have made considerable and consistent progress—and, most importantly, will continue to do so. 

Having given considerable thought to this decision to change careers, I am committed to the many months of hard work ahead of me.
