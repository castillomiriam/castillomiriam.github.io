Hey friends! So my first post was a lot more formal than this one, and I'd rather be a bit more casual with my writing style. Ok. So. Anywho. Let me share some non-technical tips with you on how to stay focused on the course when you have a lot on your plate. Maybe you're juggling a full-time job, a weekend job, school, etc., and are trying to figure out how to make it all work. No? Just me? Well, if anyone is as extra as me, these are some things that have helped me make some progress with the curriculum. Jus trying to help you not end up like this lady:

**If you're working on Fullstack Web Development part-time (like me) while working full-time (also me) here are some tips to stay on track:**

1. ***Set a schedule*** - I can't stress this enough. Figure out how many hours a day you can dedicate to coding and stick to that as much as you can. Can you use your lunch break? Do you have some down time at work? A break? A couple of free hours after work? Figure out how many hours you can dedicate per day and write all of it down. Then, try to stick to this figure as much as possible. For me it's about 20/25 hours a week, or ideally 4 hours a day M-F plus whatever I can do on weekends.  A lot of the time it works out closer to 16 hours M-F, and about 4+ hours on the weekend. It's not exact, but I try to get as close to that as possible. Managed to do more than you scheduled? Even better. 

2. ***If you mess up or don't keep up your schedule, it's ok. Just get right back into it and keep at it!* **-
A lot of the time for me it has worked out closer to 16 hours M-F with about 4+ hours on the weekend. Most of the time it's not exact, but I try to get as close to my 20 hour/week goal as possible. Sometimes things happen and you're not able to meet your goal. That's perfectly ok, as long as it's not a regular habit. Life is going to happen. In my case, I had a particularly unusual month, and I did not do as much work as I would've liked. Despite that, I tried to consistently just sit and do as much as I could when I could, and I think that's what counts. Try to do as much as you can as often as you can so that you keep the concepts fresh in your mind.

3. ***Set a timer/stopwatch/etc. to keep track of how long you've been working*** - Google has a great stopwatch feature if you just type in "stopwatch" in their search bar. Your phone stopwatch works well too. Something more thorough would be [toggl](https://www.toggl.com). A peer recommended this app in her blog and I intend on trying it out for a better analysis of my time spent working. 

4. ***Set a date you'd like to finish by and try to calculate how long it would take you based on your schedule*** - According to Flatiron, this course takes about 800 hours of work to complete. That's a long time. For someone working Fulltime+, that could mean as little as four months. For someone like me, thats closer to 10-11 months.  You can divide the 800 figure by how many hours/month you'll be spending on the course to get a rough estimate. (For me it's 800 hours total / (20 hours a week * 4 weeks in a month) = 10 months. Accounting for weeks where I do more or less than twenty hours, I expect to finish by November. Setting a goal or an end date is a huge deal for me. It helps me see the light at the end of the tunnel, prepare for the end date, and gives me motivation to keep my schedule consistent. 



Well, that's about it! Good luck to anyone reading my blog, and I promise to come back with a more technical blog post next time. Until Next time. Learn. Love. Code. XOXO, Gossip Girl. TTYL.
